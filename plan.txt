discrete features:
- parse compilation starts [0/0] annotation and create a visualization of the
  stack and how they relate together
    - each compilation represents a stack trace
    - a compilation is an ancestor of another compilation if its stack trace is a
      prefix of the other stack trace
    - this is a tree structure, so can use dot to visualize
      - sort of like a flame graph, but there is no logical length (maybe
        could use compilation time!)
- correlating generated fx graph / dynamo trace / sizes
  - just get all the graphs, display them in an indexed fashion
  - use case:
    https://fb.workplace.com/groups/1075192433118967/posts/1377556259549248/ did the sizes change?
- why are our logs so big / who is generating all the logs


infrastructure:
- parse out a single compilation [0/0]
  - start/end time for compilation

some problems:
- downloading all logs from logarithm takes surprisingly long (using lg
  command)
- there may be a lot of logs with a given MAST job, as there may be multiple
  flows pasted together, sometimes not obvious which one to look at
